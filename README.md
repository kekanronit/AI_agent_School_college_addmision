# AI_agent_School_college_addmision

This project aims to develop an AI-powered admission and enquiry assistant that automates the entire admission process in colleges. Currently, most colleges handle admissions manually â€” where staff write down student details, verify documents, and answer repetitive questions. To eliminate this manual effort, the proposed system will include a voice and text-based AI assistant that can interact with visitors in English, Hindi, and Marathi, collect their information, answer FAQs, and generate digital receipts.

The assistant will use Speech-to-Text technology to convert spoken inputs into text, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract data from uploaded ID cards or mark sheets automatically. The system will store all applicant details in a secure MySQL or Firebase database and provide an admin dashboard for staff to review, verify, and manage applications efficiently. Additionally, the assistant will offer features like auto course suggestions, PDF receipt generation, and WhatsApp/SMS notifications for updates.
